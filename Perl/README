This script queries the DynECT API for daily break down of QPS usage
and summarizes peak QPS per zone in a CSV file (default: report.csv)
As this data is only retained for a 90 day window, this script will 
automatically truncate any requests outside of those bound and will
default to the full 90 day range with no options given.

The credentials are read out of a configuration file in the
same directory name config.cfg in the format:

[Dynect]
un: user_name
cn: customer_name
pn: password

Options:
	-h --help	Show this help message and exit
	-s --start	Define an start date for the data range in YYYY-MM-DD format
	-d --days	Define total number of days to include in date range
    -f --file	Filename to write csv report

Usage:
	perl QPS_calc.pl
		Creates a CSV file (report.csv) of the previous 90 days of data broken down by
		zone and daily QPS peak

	perl QPS_calc.pl -s 2013-09-27 -d 10 -f dyn.csv
		Creates a CSV file (dyn.csv) of 10 days of data starting 2013-09-27 
		(inclusive) broken down by zone and daily QPS
